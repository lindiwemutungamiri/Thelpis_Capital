# Thelpis Capital - How to Crypto

Thelpis Capital is an African start-up, creating a financial system that makes it easy for Africans to understand, trade, and invest in cryptocurrencies. Our journey stems from personal experiences of having difficulties buying and selling cryptocurrencies on the market based on our African geographic location. We are providing an easy solution that enables Africans to trade crypto markets with ease.  

With Thelpis, we get to talk and understand cryptocurrencies from an African perspective. You also get to have free consultancy services, access to our academy pack, and periodic emails updating you on what's happening on the markets. Let's change the face of cryptocurrencies in Africa together.

## Project Components 
During the development of the Thelpis system, a Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) system that was developed by Crypto Admin was used. This addition was essential and enabled the team as Software Engineers to use a hybrid approach to development that imbibed agile and reuse orieented software engineering.
